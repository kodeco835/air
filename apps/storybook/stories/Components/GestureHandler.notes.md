# GestureHandler

---

An API for handling complex gestures. From the project's README:

> This library provides an API that exposes mobile platform specific native capabilities of touch & gesture handling and recognition. It allows for defining complex gesture handling and recognition logic that runs 100% in native thread and is therefore deterministic.

## Installation

This API is pre-installed in [managed](../../introduction/managed-vs-bare/#managed-workflow) apps. To use it in a [bare](../../introduction/managed-vs-bare/#bare-workflow) React Native app, follow its [installation instructions](https://kmagiera.github.io/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/getting-started.html).

## API

```js
import GestureHandler from 'react-native-gesture-handler';
```

Read the [react-native-gesture-handler docs](https://kmagiera.github.io/react-native-gesture-handler) for more information on the API and usage.
