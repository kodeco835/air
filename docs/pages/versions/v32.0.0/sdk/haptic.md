title: Haptic
---

> This API will be renamed to Haptics in SDK 33. If you are using the bare workflow, use that API now instead: [Haptics](../haptics/).

Provides haptic feedback for iOS 10+ devices using the Taptic Engine. If this is used in Android, the device will use `ReactNative.Vibrate` instead.

**The Taptic engine will do nothing given the following circumstances:**
* Low Power Mode is enabled
  * [Feature Request](https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/expose-low-power-mode-ios-battery-saver-android)
* User disabled the Taptic Engine in settings
  * [Feature Request](https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/react-native-settings)
* Haptic engine generation is to low (less than 2nd gen) - Private API
  * Using private API will get your app rejected: `[[UIDevice currentDevice] valueForKey: @"_feedbackSupportLevel"]` so this is not added in Expo
* iOS version is less than 10 (iPhone 7 is the first phone to support this)
  * This could be found through: `Constants.platform.ios.systemVersion` or `Constants.platform.ios.platform`

## Installation

This API is pre-installed in [managed](../../introduction/managed-vs-bare/#managed-workflow) apps. Use [Haptics](../haptics/) in a bare React Native app instead of Haptic.

## API

```js
// in managed apps:
import { Haptic } from 'expo';
```


### `Haptic.selection()`
Used to let a user know when a selection change has been registered

#### Example

```js
Haptic.selection()
```

### `Haptic.impact(style: ImpactFeedbackStyle)`

| Property  |      Type           | Description                              |

#### Example

```js
Haptic.impact(Haptic.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light)
