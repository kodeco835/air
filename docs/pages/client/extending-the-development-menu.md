title: Extending the Development Menu

import InstallSection from '~/components/plugins/InstallSection';

import ConfigurationDiff from '~/components/plugins/ConfigurationDiff';

One of the main purposes of this package was to provide an easy way to create extensions. We know that developing a React Native app can be painful - often, developers need to create additional tools, which for example, clear the local storage, to test or debug their applications. Some of their work can be integrated with the application itself to save time and make the development more enjoyable.
