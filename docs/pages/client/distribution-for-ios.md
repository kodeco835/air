> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Managed Expo projects are not yet supported**, but we are working on bringing the Development Client to the Managed Workflow! If you want to build a managed Expo project with the Development Client, you'll have to eject it first. See the [Ejecting to Bare Workflow](../workflow/customizing.md) page to learn how.

## If you are installing in a simulator

### 1. Generate a Simulator IPA

You can generate a simulator build with `xcodebuild -sdk iphonesimulator -workspace ios/[MyApp].xcworkspace -scheme [MyApp]`

### 2. Transfer Development IPA to other Developers

After running the command, the generated APK will be named **MyApp.app** and can be found under `ios/build/Release-iphonesimulator/`

<br />

You can transfer the app folder via email, shared network directory, or however you would transfer an arbitrary file. You may want to compress the `app/` folder to facilitate the transfer.

### 3. Install on simulator

After launching your simulator, you can simply drag the `app/` folder from your file explorer onto the running simulator to install it.

If you would prefer to install via the command line you can do so via `xcrun simctl install booted [path to .app folder]`

## If you are installing on a physical device

> üí° The process for installing a development client build is currently **very manual**. We are hard at work to provide a smoother flow for developers utilizing our build service.

### 1. Collect the UDID for any devices that will need to load the application

Getting the UDID from non-developers is not a foolproof process. [These](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev93ef696c6?sub=devdfa32588f) instructions should help.

### 2. Register the target devices with an Ad-hoc Distribution Profile

Your target devices will need to be registered to an Ad-hoc Distribution Profile. You can find the latest instructions for how to do so [here](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/devebd34abb1)

### 3. Export an Ad Hoc IPA

After you have set up your distribution profile, you can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.testfairy.com/iOS_SDK/Exporting_Ad_Hoc_IPA.html) to generate an IPA using the Distribution Profile

### 4. Install on device

**to install via itunes**

[godspeed](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/86806)

**to install via download**

You can serve the IPA according to the instructions [here](https://docs.monaca.io/en/products_guide/monaca_ide/deploy/non_market_deploy/) under install using OTA Deployment to allow any of your target users / devices to run your IPA after downloading it from a public URL
