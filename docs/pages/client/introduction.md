**Expo Dev Client** is an open source project to improve your development experience while working on your Expo and React Native projects. It allows your team to focus on the JavaScript portion of your project, only needing to interact with XCode or Android Studio when you need to make changes to the native code used in your project .

> ⚠️ **Managed Expo projects are not yet supported**, but we are working on bringing it to EAS Build! If you want to build a managed Expo project with the Development Client, you'll have to eject it first. See the [Ejecting to Bare Workflow](../../workflow/customizing/) page to learn how.

## Discover the Dev Client

- [Get Started with the Dev Menu](../installation/) - This is a step-by-step tutorial that will guide you through initializing a new project and kicking off a build in less than 5 mintues. If you want to experiment with EAS Build before integrating it with your existing project, this is a good place to start.
- [Coming from React Native?](../coming-from-react-native/) - You'll need to follow a couple extra steps to get up and running.
- [Distributing to Android Devices](../distribution-for-android/) - Get your development client running on an Android device.
- [Distributing to iOS Devices](../distibution-for-ios/) - Get your development client running on an iOS device.
- [Extending the Development Menu](../extending-the-development-menu/) - Add functionality to the Development Menu.
