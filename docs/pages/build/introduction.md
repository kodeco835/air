**EAS Builds** is a service for building app binaries for your React Native project. You can take advantage of it for both managed and bare Expo projects. This service is going to replace the existing build service entirely.

## Managed Expo Projects Are Not Supported Yet

Building managed Expo projects is not supported yet but we are working on bringing it to EAS Builds! If you wish to build a managed Expo project, you'll have to eject it first. See the [Ejecting to Bare Workflow](../../workflow/customizing/) page to learn how to do it.
