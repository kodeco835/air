Expo has first-class support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The JavaScript interface of the Expo SDK is completely written in TypeScript.

## Starting from scratch: using a TypeScript template

<TerminalBlock cmd={['expo init -t expo-template-blank-typescript']} />

The easiest way to get started is to initialize your new project using a TypeScript template. When you run `expo init` choose one of the templates with TypeScript in the name and then run `yarn tsc` or `npx tsc` to typecheck the project.

When you create new source files in your project you should use the `.ts` extension or the `.tsx` if the file includes React components.

## Integrating TypeScript in your existing project

Create a config file and copy over the defaults from: [`tsconfig.json`](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/master/templates/expo-template-blank-typescript/tsconfig.json)

<TerminalBlock cmd={['curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/expo/expo/master/templates/expo-template-blank-typescript/tsconfig.json -o tsconfig.json']} />

Install types in your project.

<TerminalBlock cmd={['yarn add --dev typescript @types/react @types/react-native @types/react-dom']} />

Rename files to convert them to TypeScript. For example, you would rename `App.js` to `App.tsx`.

<TerminalBlock cmd={['mv App.js App.tsx']} />

Use the `.tsx` extension if the file includes React components (JSX). If the file did not include any JSX, you can use the `.ts` file extension.

## Code editor integration

Visual Studio Code itself is written in TypeScript and has fantastic support for it out of the box. Other editors may require additional setup.

## Configuring the TypeScript compiler

`tsconfig.json` contains a variety of options that allow you to customize the behavior of the TypeScript compiler. For example, by default we enable `"noEmit"`, which tells the compiler only to typecheck and not to actually output the compiled JavaScript files (Metro, the default bundler for native React projects, takes care of that for you).

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "jsx": "react-native",
    "lib": ["dom", "esnext"],
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "noEmit": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  }
}
```

The default configuration is forgiving and makes it easier to adopt TypeScript. If you'd like to opt-in to more strict type checking, you can add `"strict": true` to the `compilerOptions`. We recommend enabling this to minimize the chance of introducing runtime errors.

Certain language features may require additional configuration, for example if you'd like to use decorators you will need to add the `experimentalDecorators` option. For more information on the available properties see the [TypeScript compiler options documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) documentation.

## Learning how to use TypeScript

A good place to start learning TypeScript is the official [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html).

### TypeScript and React components

We recommend reading over and referring to the [React TypeScript CheatSheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet) to learn how to type your React components in a variety of common situations.

#### Advanced types

If you would like to go deeper and learn how to create more expressive and powerful types, we recommend the [Advanced Static Types in TypeScript course](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-static-types-in-typescript) (this requires an egghead.io subscription).
