Sharing a link to a [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/) is a GREAT way to provide a reproducible demo :) If a reproducible demo, or a complete list of steps from blank project to bug, are not provided, it is very likely your issue will be closed. Read [here more guidance](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)."
